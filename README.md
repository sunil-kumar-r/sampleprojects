# sampleprojects

This is a sample project developed using node js and mongo db to insert required number of random data into the mongo db using POST API and fetching the data using GET API, along with saving the data to CSV file.
Added files except nodemodules, to install nodemodules kindly run "npm i" inside the project folder.
I have attached 2 images inside the project folder naming insertRandomData.png and getAllRecords.png
To run the APIs kindly execute cmd "node sample_proj.js" and after that please folloew the same steps in the image to execute APIs.
To insert data you need to pass the number value to insert specific number of data (Refer image).
After executing the GET API you can see the result data in the csv format with filename sampleData.csv in project root folder.
